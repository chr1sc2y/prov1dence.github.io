## Data Processing

### Feature Scaling (特征缩放)

Make every feature into approximaltely a $-1 \leq x_i \leq 1$ range

### Mean Normalisation (均值归一化)

Replace $x_i$ with $x_i - \mu_i$ to make features have approximately zero mean

- optimize features on similar scales

- gradient descent goes straight to the minimum
- use larger steps with gradient descent
